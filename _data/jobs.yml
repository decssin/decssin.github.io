                 I worked as a server side developer using PHP while I was working on marketing web content. 
                 Therefore, although I was lacking as a PHP developer, 
                 I worked with the help of a senior developer in many areas. 
                 I am very thankful to senior developers and learning from web developers, 
                 and I still have a lot to learn from them.

                 We've looked for ways to get to it quickly and easily from the web, 
                 such as by exploring revenue models for that content or learning how to gain more access from it.
